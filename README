This repository contains a responsive landing page created for my startup, Rush Power, a performance supplement brand dedicated to helping individuals Conquer the Storm. The project was built using HTML for semantic structure, CSS for custom styling and responsive design, and JavaScript for DOM manipulation and interactive features. The goal of this project was to establish a strong online presence for the brand while demonstrating front-end web development skills. The landing page includes a clean and structured layout, visually engaging design elements, and user-driven updates that enhance the overall experience. This project showcases my ability to design and develop a functional, modern website from scratch, with an emphasis on clarity, usability, and brand identity.
